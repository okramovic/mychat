    to whom do i send push 
        - to each member (subscription) of room, where message came from
          (except sender)
    
    who sees push
      who is not having window focused (WindowClient.focused == false)

render chatrooms on server 
    - to learn new thing
    - to save memory in browser (all those fetched files when changing rooms) ?


- is there way to detect type of connection user is using? (if on cellular data, dont load pictures to save data)
  too early in june 2018, but lights on horizon

add: componentWillUnmount: function () {
    socket.removeListener('data', this.handleData);
}

done
- react app components
  navbar with 3 chat rooms
  chat room feed
  input - text
  input file
- add some gate:
    session?
- use geametric cave paintings as background instead of space?
- add Vlads room and allowRoomAccess mdlwr
- nicer image positioning
- prevent (short) links to be understood as local 
      = add http:// in href attribute for those
- display warning 'not allowed'
- intelligent scrolling to last message
- change message input field to textarea (so it has more lines)
- add req.session gate on file upload API
- add sending files
- re-add send msg on Enter, shift+enter makes new line
- on sockets: added disconnect and error (etc) event listeners on client
- improve to whom server-socket sends new messages

- add actions to push notifs
    https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/notification-behaviour
- dont load all messages at once, do it like fb - load only 10-15 last
- add autodelete of sent files after 48 hours
- divide mesages into groups by date sent (so they are optically more separated)
- add listening for scroll event (to load new msgs) instead of button
